# JoyCon Droid TAS Theme
Uses JoyCon Droid to allow you to run TAS from a Android 9 (and onward) phone instead of Homebrew or specialized hardware!

Currently built into JoyCon Droid as TAS UI.

Uses the script format from nx-TAS.

Development has stopped for now due to Bluetooth reliability issues. Check this project later for more information.
